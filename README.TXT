PROJECT TITLE: College Advising Transcript
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A system that helps a student to determine his or her progress toward meeting graduation requirements.  The system you develop will be similar to the “Advising Transcript” that is available to DePauw students through e-Services.  However, your electronic advising transcript will be a bit more flexible in that it will allow students to select exactly what types of information they want to display.
